- **What is Git?**
  - Git is a version control system that helps you track changes in your files and collaborate with others.
  - Think of it like a magical notebook that saves every version of your work, allowing you to go back in time if you make a mistake.

- **Why is Version Control Useful?**
  - **Tracking Changes:** You can see what changes were made and by whom.
  - **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each other’s work.
  - **Backup:** If something goes wrong, you can revert to a previous version.

### Setting Up GitHub Account (15 minutes)

1. **Creating a GitHub Account:**
   - Go to GitHub.
   - Click on “Sign up” and fill out the form (choose a username, enter an email, create a password).
   - Follow the prompts to complete the setup (you may need to verify your email).

2. **Creating a New Repository:**
   - After logging in, click the “+” icon in the top right corner and select “New repository.”
   - Name your repository (e.g., `my-first-repo`).
   - Add a description (optional) and choose “Public” or “Private.”
   - Click “Create repository.”

### Practice: Using Git Locally (30 minutes)

   - If you haven’t installed Git yet, download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Create a Simple Text File:**
   - Open a text editor (like Notepad or VSCode).
   - Create a new file, write something simple (e.g., “Hello, Git!”), and save it as `hello.txt`.

3. **Initialize Git:**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the folder where you saved `hello.txt`. Use:
     ```bash
     cd path/to/your/folder
     ```

   - Initialize a Git repository:
     ```bash
     git init
     ```

## Detailed Day 2: Branching and Merging

### Overview (5 minutes)
- **Introduction to the Day's Topics:**
  - Explain that today, we will learn about branches in Git and how they help us work on different features without affecting the main project.
  - Emphasize the importance of collaboration and experimentation in coding.

### Concept: What are Branches? (10 minutes)
- **Definition of Branches:**
  - Explain that a branch is like a separate workspace where you can work on new features or fixes without changing the main project (often called the "main" or "master" branch).
  
- **Why Use Branches?**
  - **Experimentation:** You can try new ideas without risking the main project.
  - **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on different features at the same time.
  
- **Analogy:**
  - Compare branches to a tree. The trunk is the main project, and the branches are different features or experiments growing off of it.

### Activity: Creating a Branch (15 minutes)
- **Step 1: Setting Up**
  - Open your terminal or command prompt.
  - Navigate to your project directory (where your Git repository is located).

- **Step 2: Create a New Branch**
  - Explain the command to create a branch:
    ```bash
    git branch feature-readme
    ```
  - Describe what this command does: it creates a new branch called `feature-readme`.

- **Step 3: Switch to the New Branch**
  - Show how to switch to the new branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout feature-readme
    ```
  - Explain that now you are working on the `feature-readme` branch.

### Practice: Making Changes and Committing (15 minutes)
- **Step 4: Create a README File**
  - In the project folder, create a new file called `README.md`.
  - Add some simple content, like:
    ```
    # My Project
    This is a project I am working on.
    ```

- **Step 5: Stage and Commit Your Changes**
  - Stage the new file:
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    ```
  - Commit your changes with a message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add README file"
    ```

### Concept: Merging Branches (10 minutes)
- **What is Merging?**
  - Explain that merging is how we take changes from one branch and bring them into another branch (usually the main branch).
  
- **Why Merge?**
  - It combines all the features or fixes from different branches into one final project.

### Activity: Merging Back to the Main Branch (10 minutes)
- **Step 6: Switch Back to the Main Branch**
  - Switch back to the main branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

- **Step 7: Merge Your Changes**
  - Merge the changes from `feature-readme` into the main branch:
    ```bash
    git merge feature-readme
    ```
  - Explain that this combines the work from your feature branch into the main project.

### Wrap-Up and Review (5 minutes)
- **Review the Key Concepts:**
  - What is a branch and why do we use it?
  - How did we create a branch and make changes?
  - What is merging, and why is it important?

- **Encourage Questions:**
  - Invite the student to ask any questions or clarify anything they found confusing.

### Next Steps
- Suggest they try creating another branch for a new feature or experiment on their own.

## Detailed Day 3: Collaborating with Git

### Overview (5 minutes)
- **Introduction to the Day's Topics:**
  - Today, we’re going to learn how teams work together using Git. 
  - Explain that just like in a superhero team, where each hero has their own special powers, Git helps developers work together without stepping on each other’s toes.

### Concept: How Teams Use Git (10 minutes)
- **Why Collaboration is Important:**
  - Team projects can be like trying to eat spaghetti with chopsticks—fun, but messy without the right tools!
  - Git allows multiple people to work on the same project without creating chaos. 

- **How It Works:**
  - Teams can create branches for different features, just like superheroes have different missions. Each team member can work on their own branch, and Git helps merge everything back together without a fight.
  
- **Analogy:**
  - Think of Git like a giant pizza. Each person can add their favorite toppings (features) to their slice (branch) without ruining the whole pizza! And at the end, everyone gets to enjoy the finished product.

### Activity: Simulate Collaboration (15 minutes)
- **Step 1: Creating a Second GitHub Account (or Use a Friend’s)**
  - If you have a friend nearby, you can use their GitHub account. If not, walk through creating a second account (you can always delete it later, just like that embarrassing haircut you had in middle school!).
  - Remind them to use a different email address.

- **Step 2: Create a New Repository on the Second Account**
  - Have the student create a new repository (e.g., `collab-project`).
  - Explain that they’re about to become a secret agent in the Git world, working on a super secret project!

### Practice: Sharing the Repository (20 minutes)
- **Step 3: Add Collaborator**
  - Show how to go to the repository settings and add the first GitHub account as a collaborator.
  - Make it fun: "Now you’re like Batman, and your friend is Robin. You need each other to defeat the evil forces of boredom!"

- **Step 4: Clone the Repository**
  - On the first GitHub account, clone the new repository using:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
  - Explain that cloning is like making a copy of your friend's homework—totally okay in this case!

- **Step 5: Create a Branch for Changes**
  - Have the student switch to a new branch (e.g., `feature-fun`):
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-fun
    ```

- **Step 6: Make Some Changes**
  - Create a new file (e.g., `fun-facts.txt`) and add some fun facts (like “Did you know octopuses have three hearts?”).
  - Stage and commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git add fun-facts.txt
    git commit -m "Add fun facts"
    ```

### Step 7: Push Changes to GitHub (5 minutes)
- **Step 8: Push Changes**
  - Push the changes to the second account’s repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature-fun
    ```
  - Make a joke: "Now your fun facts are officially in the cloud! Just like your favorite memes!"

### Concept: Pull Requests (5 minutes)
- **What is a Pull Request?**
  - Explain that a pull request (PR) is how you ask to merge your changes back into the main project.
  - It’s like raising your hand in class to say, “Hey, I did some awesome work! Can we check it out?”

### Activity: Create a Pull Request (5 minutes)
- **Step 9: Open a Pull Request**
  - On the second account, go to the repository and click on “New Pull Request.”
  - Explain that this is where the magic happens—time to review the changes before they go into the main project!

- **Step 10: Review and Merge**
  - Go over the changes and click “Merge Pull Request.”
  - Celebrate: "Congrats! You just merged your first pull request! You're now an official Git superhero!"

### Wrap-Up and Review (5 minutes)
- **Review Key Concepts:**
  - What is collaboration, and why is it important in Git?
  - How did you simulate working together with another account?
  - What is a pull request, and how do we use it?

- **Encourage Questions:**
  - Invite the student to ask any questions or share what they enjoyed the most.

### Next Steps
- Suggest they try collaborating with a friend on a fun project, maybe adding their own silly facts or ideas.
- Encourage them to explore other Git features, like branching strategies or resolving conflicts, which can be like solving a mystery!

  - Explain that routing determines what happens when someone visits different parts of your website, and templates help us create dynamic HTML pages.

### Concept: What is Routing? (10 minutes)
- **Definition of Routing:**
  - Routing is like a map for your web app. It tells Flask what to do when someone visits a specific URL.
  
- **Why Use Routing?**
  - **Organizes Your Web App:** You can have different pages (like home, about, contact) without making separate programs.
  - **User-Friendly:** Visitors can easily navigate your site.

- **Analogy:**
  - Compare routing to a GPS. Just as your GPS directs you to different locations, routing guides users to different pages on your site.

### Activity: Create Multiple Routes (20 minutes)

  - Explain that you’ll create two new routes: one for “About” and another for “Home.”
  - Update `app.py` to include the following code:
    ```python
    from flask import Flask, render_template

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def home():
        return 'Welcome to the Home Page!'

    @app.route('/about')
    def about():
        return 'This is the About Page!'

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
    ```
  - Explain each route:
    - `@app.route('/')`: This is the home page.
    - `@app.route('/about')`: This is the about page.

- **Step 3: Test Your Routes**
  - Run the app and visit both `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` and `http://127.0.0.1:5000/about`.
  - Celebrate: “You just created multiple pages! You’re on your way to being a web wizard! 🧙‍♂️”

### Concept: What are Templates? (10 minutes)
- **Definition of Templates:**
  - Templates allow you to create HTML files that Flask can fill in with data dynamically.
  
- **Why Use Templates?**
  - **Reuse HTML Code:** You don’t have to write the same HTML over and over.
  - **Dynamic Content:** You can change the content displayed on a page without altering the code.

- **Introduction to Jinja2:**
  - Explain that Jinja2 is the templating engine used by Flask. It lets you embed Python-like syntax into your HTML.

### Practice: Use Templates to Render HTML Dynamically (15 minutes)
- **Step 4: Create a Templates Folder**
  - In your `hello_flask` project, create a new folder named `templates`.

- **Step 5: Create an HTML Template**

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>About Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>This web app is created using Flask!</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

- **Step 6: Render the Template in Flask**
  - Update the `about()` function in `app.py` to render the template:
    ```python
    @app.route('/about')
    def about():
        return render_template('about.html')
    ```

- **Step 7: Test the About Page**
  - Run the app again and visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/about`.
  - Enjoy the new look of the about page! “Now it’s not just text—it’s a fancy webpage! 🎨”

### Wrap-Up and Review (5 minutes)
- **Review Key Concepts:**
  - What is routing, and why is it important?
  - How do templates help us create dynamic web pages?
  - How did you add new routes and render a template?

  - Run the server to see your project in action:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
  - In the browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the default Django welcome page. Celebrate: “Django is up and running!”

- **Step 5: Create a New App**
  - Explain that in Django, an app is a specific module for your project. Let’s create an app called `welcome`:
    ```bash
    python manage.py startapp welcome
    ```

- **Step 6: Set Up the View**
  - Open the `welcome/views.py` file and add the following code:
    ```python
    from django.http import HttpResponse

    def welcome_view(request):
        return HttpResponse("Welcome to My Django App!")
    ```
  - Explain that this code defines a view that will return a simple welcome message.

- **Step 7: Configure the URL**
  - In the `my_django_project` directory, open the `urls.py` file (located in the project folder).
  - Modify it to include the new view:
    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path
    from welcome.views import welcome_view

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('', welcome_view),  # This will be the welcome page
    ]
    ```

- **Step 8: Test Your Welcome Page**
  - Go back to your browser and refresh the page at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
  - You should see “Welcome to My Django App!” displayed.
  - Celebrate: “You just created your first Django view! 🎉”

## Detailed Day 8: Models and Databases

### Overview (5 minutes)
- **Introduction to Today’s Topics:**
  - Today, we’ll learn about models in Django and how they help us work with databases.
  - Explain that models define the structure of our data, like how we organize toys in a collection.

### Concept: What are Models? (10 minutes)
- **Definition of Models:**
  - A model is a blueprint for how your data is structured in the database.
  - In Django, models are Python classes that define fields and behaviors of the data you want to store.

- **Why Use Models?**
  - **Organized Data:** Models help keep your data structured and easy to manage.
  - **Database Interaction:** They provide an easy way to interact with the database without writing raw SQL.

- **Analogy:**
  - Think of a model like a recipe for your favorite dish. It lists all the ingredients (fields) and how to combine them (methods) to make something delicious (the data).

### Activity: Create a Model for a Toy Collection (20 minutes)
- **Step 1: Set Up Your App**
  - Ensure you’re in the Django project directory (`my_django_project`) and navigate to the `welcome` app.

- **Step 2: Create a Toy Model**
  - Open the `models.py` file in the `welcome` directory and add the following code:
    ```python
    from django.db import models

    class Toy(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        toy_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.name
    ```
  - Explain each part of the code:
    - `name`: A character field to store the toy's name.
    - `toy_type`: A character field to store the type of toy (e.g., action figure, puzzle).
    - `__str__`: A method that defines how the object is represented as a string.

- **Step 3: Register the Model**
  - To make the model available in the Django admin, open the `admin.py` file in the `welcome` directory and add:
    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import Toy

    admin.site.register(Toy)
    ```
  - Explain that this allows the toy model to be managed through the Django admin interface.

### Practice: Run Migrations to Create the Database (20 minutes)
- **Step 4: Create Migrations**
  - Explain that migrations are like instructions for the database on how to set up models.
  - In the terminal, run the following command to create migrations for your new model:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```
  - Fun note: “This is like writing down your recipe so you don’t forget it!”

- **Step 5: Apply Migrations**
  - Now, run the migrations to create the database tables:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
  - Explain that this command applies the migration and sets up the database structure.

- **Step 6: Access the Django Admin**
  - Create a superuser account to access the Django admin:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
  - Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password.
  
- **Step 7: View the Toy Model in Admin**
  - Start the development server if it’s not running:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
  - Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` in a web browser.
  - Log in with the superuser credentials and find the Toy model in the admin panel.
  - Celebrate: “You just created a model for your toy collection! 🎉”

### Wrap-Up and Review (5 minutes)
- **Review Key Concepts:**
  - What is a model in Django, and how does it relate to databases?
  - What fields did we create for the Toy model?
  - How did we run migrations to set up our database?

- **Encourage Questions:**
  - Invite the student to ask any questions they may have about models, databases, or Django in general.

### Next Steps
- Suggest they experiment with adding more fields to the Toy model (like `color` or `age`) and create different models (e.g., for a game collection).
- Encourage them to explore how to add and manage data in the admin interface, turning their collection into a real app!

  - Emphasize the importance of collaboration and experimentation in coding.

### Concept: What are Branches? (10 minutes)
- **Definition of Branches:**
  - Explain that a branch is like a separate workspace where you can work on new features or fixes without changing the main project (often called the "main" or "master" branch).
  
- **Why Use Branches?**
  - **Experimentation:** You can try new ideas without risking the main project.
  - **Collaboration:** Multiple people can work on different features at the same time.
  
- **Analogy:**
  - Compare branches to a tree. The trunk is the main project, and the branches are different features or experiments growing off of it.

### Activity: Creating a Branch (15 minutes)
- **Step 1: Setting Up**
  - Open your terminal or command prompt.
  - Navigate to your project directory (where your Git repository is located).

- **Step 2: Create a New Branch**
  - Explain the command to create a branch:
    ```bash
    git branch feature-readme
    ```
  - Describe what this command does: it creates a new branch called `feature-readme`.

- **Step 3: Switch to the New Branch**
  - Show how to switch to the new branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout feature-readme
    ```
  - Explain that now you are working on the `feature-readme` branch.

### Practice: Making Changes and Committing (15 minutes)
- **Step 4: Create a README File**
  - In the project folder, create a new file called `README.md`.
  - Add some simple content, like:
    ```
    # My Project
    This is a project I am working on.
    ```

- **Step 5: Stage and Commit Your Changes**
  - Stage the new file:
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    ```
  - Commit your changes with a message:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Add README file"
    ```

### Concept: Merging Branches (10 minutes)
- **What is Merging?**
  - Explain that merging is how we take changes from one branch and bring them into another branch (usually the main branch).
  
- **Why Merge?**
  - It combines all the features or fixes from different branches into one final project.

### Activity: Merging Back to the Main Branch (10 minutes)
- **Step 6: Switch Back to the Main Branch**
  - Switch back to the main branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout main
    ```

- **Step 7: Merge Your Changes**
  - Merge the changes from `feature-readme` into the main branch:
    ```bash
    git merge feature-readme
    ```
  - Explain that this combines the work from your feature branch into the main project.

### Wrap-Up and Review (5 minutes)
- **Review the Key Concepts:**
  - What is a branch and why do we use it?
  - How did we create a branch and make changes?
  - What is merging, and why is it important?

## Detailed Day 3: Collaborating with Git

### Overview (5 minutes)
- **Introduction to the Day's Topics:**
  - Today, we’re going to learn how teams work together using Git. 
  - Explain that just like in a superhero team, where each hero has their own special powers, Git helps developers work together without stepping on each other’s toes.

### Concept: How Teams Use Git (10 minutes)
- **Why Collaboration is Important:**
  - Team projects can be like trying to eat spaghetti with chopsticks—fun, but messy without the right tools!
  - Git allows multiple people to work on the same project without creating chaos. 

- **How It Works:**
  - Teams can create branches for different features, just like superheroes have different missions. Each team member can work on their own branch, and Git helps merge everything back together without a fight.
  
- **Analogy:**
  - Think of Git like a giant pizza. Each person can add their favorite toppings (features) to their slice (branch) without ruining the whole pizza! And at the end, everyone gets to enjoy the finished product.

### Activity: Simulate Collaboration (15 minutes)
- **Step 1: Creating a Second GitHub Account (or Use a Friend’s)**
  - If you have a friend nearby, you can use their GitHub account. If not, walk through creating a second account (you can always delete it later, just like that embarrassing haircut you had in middle school!).
  - Remind them to use a different email address.

- **Step 2: Create a New Repository on the Second Account**
  - Have the student create a new repository (e.g., `collab-project`).
  - Explain that they’re about to become a secret agent in the Git world, working on a super secret project!

### Practice: Sharing the Repository (20 minutes)
- **Step 3: Add Collaborator**
  - Show how to go to the repository settings and add the first GitHub account as a collaborator.
  - Make it fun: "Now you’re like Batman, and your friend is Robin. You need each other to defeat the evil forces of boredom!"

- **Step 4: Clone the Repository**
  - On the first GitHub account, clone the new repository using:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
  - Explain that cloning is like making a copy of your friend's homework—totally okay in this case!

- **Step 5: Create a Branch for Changes**
  - Have the student switch to a new branch (e.g., `feature-fun`):
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-fun
    ```

- **Step 6: Make Some Changes**
  - Create a new file (e.g., `fun-facts.txt`) and add some fun facts (like “Did you know octopuses have three hearts?”).
  - Stage and commit the changes:
    ```bash
    git add fun-facts.txt
    git commit -m "Add fun facts"
    ```

### Step 7: Push Changes to GitHub (5 minutes)
- **Step 8: Push Changes**
  - Push the changes to the second account’s repository:
    ```bash
    git push origin feature-fun
    ```
  - Make a joke: "Now your fun facts are officially in the cloud! Just like your favorite memes!"

### Concept: Pull Requests (5 minutes)
- **What is a Pull Request?**
  - Explain that a pull request (PR) is how you ask to merge your changes back into the main project.
  - It’s like raising your hand in class to say, “Hey, I did some awesome work! Can we check it out?”

### Activity: Create a Pull Request (5 minutes)
- **Step 9: Open a Pull Request**
  - On the second account, go to the repository and click on “New Pull Request.”
  - Explain that this is where the magic happens—time to review the changes before they go into the main project!

- **Step 10: Review and Merge**
  - Go over the changes and click “Merge Pull Request.”
  - Celebrate: "Congrats! You just merged your first pull request! You're now an official Git superhero!"

### Wrap-Up and Review (5 minutes)
- **Review Key Concepts:**
  - What is collaboration, and why is it important in Git?
  - How did you simulate working together with another account?
  - What is a pull request, and how do we use it?

    ```
  - Fun note: “It’s like getting a shiny new set of LEGO bricks delivered to your door!”

- **Step 2: Create a New Django Project**
  - After installation, create a new Django project by running:
    ```bash
    django-admin startproject my_django_project
    ```
  - Explain that this command sets up a new directory with all the files needed for a Django project.

- **Step 3: Navigate into Your Project Folder**
  - Change directories to the new project:
    ```bash
    cd my_django_project
    ```

### Activity: Create a Simple “Welcome” Page Using Django Views (25 minutes)

  - Run the server to see your project in action:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
  - In the browser, go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000` to see the default Django welcome page. Celebrate: “Django is up and running!”

- **Step 5: Create a New App**
  - Explain that in Django, an app is a specific module for your project. Let’s create an app called `welcome`:
    ```bash
    python manage.py startapp welcome
    ```

- **Step 6: Set Up the View**
  - Open the `welcome/views.py` file and add the following code:
    ```python
    from django.http import HttpResponse

    def welcome_view(request):
        return HttpResponse("Welcome to My Django App!")
    ```
  - Explain that this code defines a view that will return a simple welcome message.

- **Step 7: Configure the URL**
  - In the `my_django_project` directory, open the `urls.py` file (located in the project folder).
  - Modify it to include the new view:
    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path
    from welcome.views import welcome_view

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('', welcome_view),  # This will be the welcome page
    ]
    ```

- **Step 8: Test Your Welcome Page**
  - Go back to your browser and refresh the page at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
  - You should see “Welcome to My Django App!” displayed.
  - Celebrate: “You just created your first Django view! 🎉”

### Wrap-Up and Review (5 minutes)

## Detailed Day 8: Models and Databases

### Overview (5 minutes)
- **Introduction to Today’s Topics:**
  - Today, we’ll learn about models in Django and how they help us work with databases.
  - Explain that models define the structure of our data, like how we organize toys in a collection.

### Concept: What are Models? (10 minutes)
- **Definition of Models:**
  - A model is a blueprint for how your data is structured in the database.
  - In Django, models are Python classes that define fields and behaviors of the data you want to store.

- **Why Use Models?**
  - **Organized Data:** Models help keep your data structured and easy to manage.
  - **Database Interaction:** They provide an easy way to interact with the database without writing raw SQL.

- **Analogy:**
  - Think of a model like a recipe for your favorite dish. It lists all the ingredients (fields) and how to combine them (methods) to make something delicious (the data).

### Activity: Create a Model for a Toy Collection (20 minutes)
- **Step 1: Set Up Your App**
  - Ensure you’re in the Django project directory (`my_django_project`) and navigate to the `welcome` app.

- **Step 2: Create a Toy Model**
  - Open the `models.py` file in the `welcome` directory and add the following code:
    ```python
    from django.db import models

    class Toy(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        toy_type = models.CharField(max_length=50)

        def __str__(self):
            return self.name
    ```
  - Explain each part of the code:
    - `name`: A character field to store the toy's name.
    - `toy_type`: A character field to store the type of toy (e.g., action figure, puzzle).
    - `__str__`: A method that defines how the object is represented as a string.

- **Step 3: Register the Model**
  - To make the model available in the Django admin, open the `admin.py` file in the `welcome` directory and add:
    ```python
    from django.contrib import admin
    from .models import Toy

    admin.site.register(Toy)
    ```
  - Explain that this allows the toy model to be managed through the Django admin interface.

### Practice: Run Migrations to Create the Database (20 minutes)
- **Step 4: Create Migrations**
  - Explain that migrations are like instructions for the database on how to set up models.
  - In the terminal, run the following command to create migrations for your new model:
    ```bash
    python manage.py makemigrations
    ```
  - Fun note: “This is like writing down your recipe so you don’t forget it!”

- **Step 5: Apply Migrations**
  - Now, run the migrations to create the database tables:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```
  - Explain that this command applies the migration and sets up the database structure.

- **Step 6: Access the Django Admin**
  - Create a superuser account to access the Django admin:
    ```bash
    python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```
  - Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password.
  
- **Step 7: View the Toy Model in Admin**
  - Start the development server if it’s not running:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```
  - Go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` in a web browser.
  - Log in with the superuser credentials and find the Toy model in the admin panel.
  - Celebrate: “You just created a model for your toy collection! 🎉”

### Wrap-Up and Review (5 minutes)
- **Review Key Concepts:**
  - What is a model in Django, and how does it relate to databases?
  - What fields did we create for the Toy model?
  - How did we run migrations to set up our database?

- **Encourage Questions:**
  - Invite the student to ask any questions they may have about models, databases, or Django in general.

### Next Steps
- Suggest they experiment with adding more fields to the Toy model (like `color` or `age`) and create different models (e.g., for a game collection).
- Encourage them to explore how to add and manage data in the admin interface, turning their collection into a real app!

    ```bash
    git init
    ```
  - Fun note: “It’s like putting your project into a time capsule!”

#### Step 2: Create a .gitignore File
- **Step 2.1: Why .gitignore?**
  - This file tells Git which files and folders to ignore (like virtual environments or compiled files).

- **Step 2.2: Create .gitignore**
  - Create a new file named `.gitignore` in your project directory and add the following lines:
    ```
    __pycache__/
    *.pyc
    venv/
    *.db
    ```
  - Explain that these lines help keep your repository clean.

### Practice: Make Commits for Each New Feature or Change (25 minutes)

#### Step 3: Make Your First Commit
- **Step 3.1: Stage Your Changes**
  - After making changes or adding files, you need to stage them:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
  - Fun note: “It’s like packing your suitcase before a trip!”

- **Step 3.2: Commit Your Changes**
  - Now, commit your changes with a message describing what you did:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: set up Flask/Django project"
    ```
  - Explain that this creates a snapshot of your project at this point in time.

#### Step 4: Make Further Changes and Commit
- **Step 4.1: Add a New Feature**
  - Suggest making a small change, like adding a new route or function to your Flask/Django app.

- **Step 4.2: Repeat the Commit Process**
  - After making the change:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added a new route for the toy collection"
    ```
  - Encourage them to describe their changes clearly in the commit message.

#### Step 5: Review Commit History
- **Step 5.1: Check Your Commit History**
  - Show how to view the commit history:
    ```bash
    git log
    ```
  - Fun note: “It’s like looking through an album of your project’s progress!”

### Wrap-Up and Review (5 minutes)
